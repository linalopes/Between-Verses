## Side Arms Pose Guide

### What the pose should look like:
1. **Stand upright** with feet shoulder-width apart
2. **Raise both elbows** to shoulder level (like you're going to flex your biceps)
3. **Point your hands/wrists upward** - like you're celebrating a victory
4. **Keep elbows wide** - away from your body to the sides
5. **Both arms should be symmetric** - same position on both sides

### Think of it like:
- 🏆 **Victory pose** - like you just won something
- 💪 **Flex pose** - but with hands pointing up instead of making fists
- 🙌 **Celebration** - but with elbows at shoulder level

### Key points:
- Wrists should be **higher than elbows**
- Wrists should be **higher than shoulders** 
- Elbows should be **out to the sides**
- Both arms should be **in the same position**

The pose should now be much easier to detect with the improved logic!
